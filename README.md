# Permit.js

## Overview
Permit.js makes building interactive, multi-state prototypes for websites and apps easy.

Maybe your website has certain features that are only available to logged-in members and other features only available only to administrators. Or perhaps your app has different features depending on whether it's on- or offline. Or what about the free versus paid versions? These are all examples of state.

Permit.js makes simulating those different situations a breeze. It's designed for use by anyone that does interactive protype work in HTML and CSS, including information architects and other user interface and user experience (UI/UX) professionals.
